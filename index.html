    <h1>Space Is The Best</h1>
    <p>Space is a three-dimensional continuum containing positions and directions.[1] In classical physics, physical
         space is often conceived in three linear dimensions. Modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime.[2] The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over
         whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.</p>

         <p>The universe is all of space and time[a] and their contents.[10] It comprises all of existence,
          any fundamental interaction, physical process and physical constant, and therefore all forms of 
          energy and matter, and the structures they form, from sub-atomic particles to entire galaxies.
           Space and time, according to the prevailing cosmological theory of the Big Bang, emerged together
            13.787Â±0.020 billion years ago,[11] and the universe has been expanding ever since. Today the 
            universe has expanded into an age and size that is physically only in parts observable as the 
            observable universe, which is approximately 93 billion light-years in diameter at the present 
            day, while the spatial size, if any, of the entire universe is unknown.[3]</p>
